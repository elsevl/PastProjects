          <div class="row-item" id="row2"><p>In addition to being a best-selling author, JK Rowling has donated a significant amount of her wealth to charitable foundations she either supports or established herself. Rowling became a billionaire in 2004; however, she fell off the Forbes billionaire list in 2012 having donated 16% of her wealth ($160,000,000) to charities the previous year. Below are four charities that Rowling has focused her efforts on: </p></div>
          <ul>
           <div class="row-item" id="row3"><li><a href="http://annerowlingclinic.com/" target=_blank>Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic</a>- The clinic is a medical research facility located at the University of Edinburgh focusing on the treatment of degenerative neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, and Parkinson's Disease. The clinic is named after Rowling's mother, who passed away from multiple sclerosis in 1990. In 2010, Rowling donated $10,000,000 to the University of Edinburgh to establish the clinic in her mother's name.</li></div>
           <div class="row-item" id="row4"><li><a href="https://www.comicrelief.com/" target=_blank>Comic Relief</a>- A charity located in the UK whose mission is to eliminate poverty through the power of entertainment. The organization raises money through high-profile campaigns such as school fundraisers, telethons and the world-famous Red Nose Day.</li></div>
            <div class="row-item" id="row5"><li><a href="https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/" target=_blank>Gingerbread</a>- A charity located in the UK whose focus is assisting single parents through providing information, advice, and services. Rowling was the charity's first ambassador beginning in 2000, before later being promoted to the organization's president position. Rowling was a single parent for most of the 1990's following the divorce from her first husband, which ultimately led to her support of this organization.</li></div>
            <div class="row-item" id="row6"><li><a href="https://wearelumos.org/" target=_blank>Lumos</a>- Rowling founded Lumos in 2005, named after the light-giving spell from her Harry Potter books. The charity's mission is to eradicate the use of orphanage institutions by the year 2050 by reuniting institutionalized children with their families or by finding the children loving homes.</li></div>
